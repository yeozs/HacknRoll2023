# Reason for Project Creation: Hackathon Competition
- Makes use of React, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Socket IO Features

How to use the application:
- Download All Files from Git Repository
- cd to directory, run npm start
- Go to localhost:3000 for Home page, localhost:3001 for Live Chat Room
- Open 2 windows for localhost:3001 and type message. Message will be shown in both windows, differentiated by colour.
